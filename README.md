# College Python Project

This is a project folder created for coursework at Southern New Hampshire University as part of my Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity.

The goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate foundational Python programming concepts including:

- Decision branching (if/else statements)
- Conditional logic
- Looping structures
- Variable handling
- PyCharm IDE usage
- Git and version control basics

As I continue developing this project, Iâ€™ll be updating it with more examples and practice exercises as I progress through the course modules.

## Tools Used
- Python 3.x
- PyCharm
- Git & GitHub

## Notes
This is part of my journey into combining my extensive leadership and management background with new technical skills in cybersecurity, coding, and project management.
